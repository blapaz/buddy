## About

Buddy is an experimental project designed to make interaction with Windows events easier. Scripts can be written in a simple language to interact with these Windows events. 

At its core, Buddy's main purpose is listening for hotkeys that can run a task (eg. taking a screenshot when a specific hotkey combination is pressed). However, the scripting can be used to extended further beyond that. 

One goal for this project over time, would be to have a well developed and stable language available with many system functions built in.

## Example

```
import system

function Main()
{
    PrintLine("Hello World")
}

event Control_C() 
{
	PrintLine("Clipboard")
}

event Control_W() 
{
	PrintLine("Control+W")
	Delay("5000")
	PrintLine("Screenshot")
	CaptureScreen("")
}
```

When this script is executed:
- The main function ```Main()``` will run immediately
- The event functions ```Control_C()``` and ```Control_W()``` will run when the corresponding key combinations are pressed 
  - Pressing Control and C will run ```Control_C()```
  - Pressing Control and W will run ```Control_W()```.

_For more examples, please refer to the [scripts folder](https://github.com/blapaz/buddy/tree/master/scripts) in the project_
